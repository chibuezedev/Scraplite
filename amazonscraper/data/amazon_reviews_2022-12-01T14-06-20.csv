B09G9FPHY6,"So I have 1 problem with this new 9th gen… the battery life is not any better than the 8th gen I replaced. Just checked & I have 9 charge cycles at only 99% capacity (below 100% already is huge red flag)!?! My 8th gen at this time was still at 105% capacity-both from Coconut battery app MacBook. I actually believe the 8th gen got at least 45mins possibly 1 hour more per charge when using airplane mode + Wi-Fi doing the same stuff/same settings. The safari homepage for some reason does not sync my most frequently visited websites/nor can I view webpages on iPad that I visit/open on my iPhone, or receive text messages from iPhone on my iPads iMessage (it used to work, now does not & I’ve tried everything)… all these things just worked flawlessly on iPad 8th gen! Since I don’t use the center stage camera, the only improvement that I recognize is the 64gb SSD.

B09G9FPHY6,"I use this for note taking as I am a pre med undergrad student. Having all my notes on me in one place is the most convenient thing. Every time I threw away a notebook with a whole semester’s work inside it, a little part of me died inside. I also have a loooooooooot of school ahead of me, and so it will be really cool to have notes I wrote down three years ago just a few taps away.It is the ‘smaller’ version, but I am a small person. I can still do the side by side thing (having the IPad split with the textbook on left side, and your note taking app on the right side), but for others it may be too small. The ease of use of the Apple Pencil and the notability app blow my mind. I literally look forward to taking notes in class on my IPad. It is is seamless- highlighting and changing colors, dragging in images from textbooks… that is so freakin cool.So this is truly wonderful. Worth it worth it worth it.

Every device we own from this brand, gets used to its fullest potential or passed to someone in the family when we upgrade.

B09G9FPHY6,"For those who wonder, this is brand new in the box, 2021 9th generation. It is NOT refurbed or an exchange. It is never opened and shrink wrapped by Apple. (See my photos.) The reason it is so much cheaper than the other 2021 iPads is the 64gb storage. But with iCloud so ridiculously cheap for cloud storage, I just cannot see this 64gb as not getting the job done. I myself was curious about this low price buying me a refurb/exchange, but that is simply not the case here. I do, however, recommend you not go with 32gb. I believe even with an iCloud account, you will be sorry you didn’t go 64gb.And the ease of setting this up cannot be understated. I simply sat my iPhone 13 Pro Max next to it and all relevant files and Wi-Fi passwords were transferred over with no input from me. It looked to me that it will do that with Android and most laptops also, though I did not test that out. All photos also came over, and the ones I took after that transfer, I simply Air-Dropped them into this iPad. All in all, this is as simple as it gets for transferring files and photos. Apple has this stuff down to a science, believe me.This screen is incredible. If you are looking at a pre-Retina screen, you will be amazed at this 2021 version. This thing is very fast, the on screen keyboard is fast, accurate and very concise. Dealing with apps is easy, and Apple doesn’t load you down with bloat you’ll never use. It is claimed this has about 12 hours on a charge; what I’ve seen thus far leads me to believe that is accurate.All in all, I am extremely pleased with this purchase. You can’t always say you got what you paid for. But I can definitely say that with this. This is the entry level 2021 9th generation iPad, and it is exactly what I need.

Well this is the perfect thing for you, the screen is just the right size and very crisp and clear(maybe better then my iPhone X), the responsiveness is excellent, and all of the streaming sites work with this perfectly. On top of that, my AirPods automatically switch between this and my phone, so I don’t have to worry about messing with the settings every time. However, the camera is only OK.

B09G9FPHY6,"I'm not much of an apple product person but I do buy them for people I don't want to provide tech support to. (Parents, In-laws, Wife, and Kids)I used to use the fire tablets because they were cheap and I thought that would keep the kids entertained, especially on road trips. This worked for movies and some games but there were always problems with how slow they become with updates, loss of battery life, etc.This ipad was a game changer.  I always knew they were the ""best tablets"" but I was also a bit in denial as well as just being somewhat anti-apple. With this on sale during prime day 2022 (July) I took a chance and bought one for the kids.This does everything as well or better (usually better) than previous tablets I had purchased because they were cheaper.I also didn't buy a case for it and my kids are brutal with these types of devices. To date, it is still in one piece, operational, and has no cracks in the screen.Sometimes it is worth paying a bit more for the name brand product and in this case I'm a believer.",Kids love it,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 2, 2022",True,5.0
B09G9FPHY6,"I got this for my uncle to share with his grandson, and it is a great starter/introductory tablet for anyone wanting to get into the Apple ecosystem. It is more affordable than the iPad 10th gen (which is pretty much an iPad Air re-release) that just got announced by a landslide, and it has accessibility with the Apple Pen. The iPad 9th gen is zippy and smooth when opening apps or taking notes. Get a nice case for it, and you'll have this iPad for the next few years without issue. The parental controls are very easy to set up, and the User Interface is easy to navigate for both my uncle, who is in his 60s, and his grandson, who is 2. It's a win-win.

B09G9FPHY6,"I have had an ipad air since they came out.  I used hotel points to get it and its served me well as a book and simple internet use.  Recently I noticed that it was no updating and some of my favorite apps were telling me they were using an old version because my IOS was outdated.  Without being able to update it I decided to pass my old one on and get a new one.  Then I thought I'd get a mini 6 but after comparing the prices and the ability I could not justify a double price for it.  I ordered this Ipad 9 and it came quicker than expected.  Out of the box it performs much better than my old one, screen appears clearer and I like the new IOS it uses.  My old one will live on as a small tv for my wife when shes in the kitchen and for that it does very well.  I have no complaints about my new one.
